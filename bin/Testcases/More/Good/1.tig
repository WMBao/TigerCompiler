/*

	Simple test cases for parsing Tiger programs.

	The Tiger programs below are intended to help you work on your 
parser. This file concentrates on the basics. I tried to include
an exemplar of each basic syntactic construction. When getting your
interpreter to work, these should also provide some simple test cases
for evaluation.

	The programs in this file should all be correct. (If they are
not, please email me and the class!) There is nothing tricky or clever
about these. I will email out a file containing more advanced
constructions, which will have some examples that deliberately contain
errors.

	If you run across a particularly interesting or instructive 
test case, please feel free to post it on the newsgroup.

	Have fun!
